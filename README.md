# GameOfLife-RHEdition
Robert Heaton Advanced beginner project 2, making a "Game of Life" program for the console. As usual, it is me learning and failing at it, so probably not the best code you can find on the internet. Dependencies are the curses package. If you are on Windows, remember to install curses-windows through pip, as windows requires this extra specific package to make a curses interface.
